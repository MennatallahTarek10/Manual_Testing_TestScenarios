# Manual_Testing_TestScenarios

**What is a Test Scenario?**
A Test Scenario is defined as any functionality that can be tested. It is also called Test Condition or Test Possibility. As a tester, you should put yourself in the end userâ€™s shoes and figure out the real-world scenarios and use cases of the Application Under Test.

**Scenario Testing** in software testing is a method in which actual scenarios are used for testing the software application instead of test cases. The purpose of scenario testing is to test end to end scenarios for a specific complex problem of the software. Scenarios help in an easier way to test and evaluate end to end complicated problems.
